      Ascension Tactics pioneered a brand-new genre to critical acclaim by combining
      the best of tactical miniatures games with the fast-paced strategy of deck-building
      games. The most iconic characters from the award-winning deck-building game were
      brought to life as highly-detailed paintable 3D miniatures.

    Producing projects like this isn't easy. COVID related delays, delays in shipping and
    global logistics may all delay the production of this game.
    We've learned a lot over the years and are building in safeguards to
    ensure that products are delivered ontime and at a high quality to backers.

      I'm creating pendants that are a combination of my favorite things, drawing,
      sculpture and bits of all of the magical items I've collected. This is my way to immortalize
      and honor the washed up forgotten souls I find under foot on my nature walks.

    This is my first Kickstarter and it's a project close to my heart.
    Each piece is handmade by me and is one-of-a-kind.
    While these take time and great care to make I am confident I will have my rewards shipped by early May.
    I will keep you updated along the way. Thank you friends. <3

    story="""
      We're back and ready to introduce our brand new Revopoint RANGE, the world's first affordable 
      large objects scanner with a single capture range of 360mm x 650 mm@600mm. As many of you already know, 
      Revopoint is no stranger to Kickstarters. With over 17,000 backers and more than $8.2 million raised 
      from three successful Kickstarter campaigns for the POP, POP 2, and MINI 3D Scanners.
    """,
    risks="""
    We are more than confident that we can deliver the Revopoint RANGE as the design and 
    engineering work are finished, and we have already extensively tested it. Furthermore, 
    we have successfully run three previous Kickstarter projects, and our manufacturing and 
    supply capacity has expanded and matured over these projects. In other words, aside from any logistical challenges that might arise and 
    which we commit to solving promptly, we do not see any risk on the projectâ€™s horizon.
